## Friendzoned

### Overview
Born out of a desperation to hang out with friends and an extreme fear of bothering people who are busy (yes, even with a text), "Friendzoned" would be an easier, more passive way to tell someone, "Hey! I like you! Let's hang out! We're adults!"

The gist of the application is, once you know that you are available and interested in hanging out with someone, you open up the application, tick a check box (marked "Morning", "Afternoon", "Evening", "Late Night", etc.) and hit submit. In a perfect world, your friend would also do the same. When you (or anyone else) has checked the same box as you, a notification is sent to the respective people with an optional message for what you'd like to do (or default if you have no clue). Now, it's up to you to text said person and get to hanging out and culivating your ever-elusive adult friendships!

I feel like this program is something that might be quite useful for most people in this day and age who have no clue how to start a hanging out session with people that you don't really know that well. It'll act as an easier, more convienient ice breaker than just simply "cold calling" someone out of the blue without knowing what their day is like. Moving forward, it'd be cool to have groups of friends (I personally have a group, we call ourselves the Super Team. Yes, it could be percieved as lame, but I don't care.) and if you add people to your group, some of them could get a push notification (if they've elected to have them) even if they haven't checked a box yet.

Let's connect. Face to face. Friend style. Friend zone. Yeah.
