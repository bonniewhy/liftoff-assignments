# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Friendzoned

### Overview
Born out of a desperation to hang out with friends and an extreme fear of bothering people who are busy (yes, even with a text), "Friendzoned" would be an easier, more passive way to tell someone, "Hey! I like you! We're adults! Let's hang out!"

The gist of the application is, once you know that you are available and interested in hanging out with someone, you open up the application, tick a check box (marked "Morning", "Afternoon", "Evening", "Late Night", etc.) and hit submit. In a perfect world, your friend would also do the same. When you (or anyone else) has checked the same box as you, a notification is sent to the respective people with an optional message for what you'd like to do (or default if you have no clue). Now, it's up to you to text said person and get to hanging out and culivating your ever-elusive adult friendships!

I feel like this program is something that might be quite useful for most people in this day and age who have no clue how to start hanging out with people that they don't really know that well. It'll act as an easier, more convenient ice breaker than just simply "cold calling" someone out of the blue without knowing what their day is like. Moving forward, it'd be cool to have groups of friends (I personally have a group, we call ourselves the Super Team. Yes, it could be percieved as lame, but I don't care.) and if you add people to your group, some of them could get a push notification (if they've elected to have them) even if they haven't checked a box yet.

Let's connect. Face to face. Friend style. Friend zone. Yeah.

### Features
- **USER ACCOUNTS**: It would be quite cool to figure out how to integrate Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat with this. However, that might be out of the scope of the minimum viable product. Regardless, we are going to need to have an account with a profile of some sort so that users can add each other as friends and get the notifications they so desperately know they want.
- **ADD FRIENDS / MAKE A GROUP**: Add people as friends from their profile pages (maybe by their phone number or email address?). Add people to friend groups. Accept friend requests and friend group invitations to confirm that you do, in fact, have a desire to hang out with said person.
- **CHECKBOXES / SENDING NOTIFICATIONS**: Main meat of the application. The infamous checkboxes, complete with an optional field to add what you'd like to do today, plus the notification that would send (like matching on Tinder) once you've both selected the same checkbox.
- **(OPT) REMOVE OR BLOCK FRIENDS / YOURSELF FROM A GROUP**: A way to remove or block yourself as someone's friend if you didn't enjoy hanging out with them / just don't want to have their notifications anymore. This is something I'm not sure will be done in the 2 months I have.
- **(OPT) SEND A TEXT VIA THE APP**: It would be ultimately more convenient to be able to just press a button and have an automatic message sent saying "Let's Hang Out!" once finding out that someone has checked the same box as you.

### Technologies
Java
Spring Boot
MySQL
Thymeleaf templates
Responsive HTML / CSS
Some kind of telephony API?

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will actually have to learn a lot to accomplish this application. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but there are quite a few things in here I don't know how to do. It would be very fun to learn how to integrate telecommunications in with an app and figure out how to actually build an Android / iPhone app that would not be a web app. However, I feel like the first MVP would be built as a web app form, just to ease me into the rest.
