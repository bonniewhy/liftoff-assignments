## Chore Wheel

### Overview
Do you ever look around your house and say, "Boy, this house is a pig stye!" And then promptly sit down on your couch the rest of the day watching television, crippled with sensory overload at the sheer amount of things you need to accomplish? Me, too! Always. Like even right now. You're in luck, though! Because I have a solution for you. It's called...

#### THE CHORE WHEEL!!!!!

Aren't you just so excited? Well, you should be. THIS chore wheel will be different from every other chore wheel you've ever encountered. Because this one will be fun! You access the website (logging in is optional!) and spin the wheel (a la Trivia Crack or Wheel of Fortune!). As the colors / options spin, you wait with anticipation as it lands on the chore you should do today, effectively curing your procrastination tendencies by choosing the unpleasant thing you need to do for you, thus saving you hours of time deciding what to work on!

But wait, there's more! You can also create an account and log in to keep track of what chores you've done and when chores need to be done again. Each category will have a way for you to add new things to them that are specific to your own house and a frequency of how often those things should be done. Each time you spin the wheel while logged in, it'll have the list of things that needs to get done in that specific category to choose from. If you've already done it and it doesn't need to be done again, it will be greyed out, therefore making it easy for you to keep track of how often you do things that don't need to be done as often. Genius!

I got the idea to make this based on the episode of the Office where Pam tries to make a chore wheel, but no one likes it cause it doesn't spin. I thought, that seems like just enough fun to make horrible, boring, awful chores (yes, I'm an adult...) more bearable and fun to do. Possibly, I could add in the tiny wheel to pick between the smaller, more specific categories for an added Office cameo. I also feel like there is some potential to add bonuses and streaks and all sorts of things. Though, not quite sure what the bonuses would be yet. The point is to make undesireable tasks more fun, like a game.
