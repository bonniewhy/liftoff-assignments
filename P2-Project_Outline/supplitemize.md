# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

### Overview
This program would be a quick and convenient way to keep track of all of the art supplies you have, the back log of projects you'd like to complete, and the supplies you need so when you're randomly at the closest art supply store because of impulsivity and boredom. You can look at what kinds of things you might need to buy to complete the projects that you've been procrastinating against because you don't have the right supplies. For instance, instead of buying more yarn even though you already have 30 skeins of red yarn and really, really need orange yarn. 

The minimum viable product will have you manually entering in your projects and what you need and what you have in stock. However, if there is a way to make it easier and more automatic later, that is which direction I'd like it to go in (scanning barcodes and having it populate the list of things you own already by itself). I originally thought of this idea because I am often in this predicament when out and about. Sometimes I just like going to the store, and I really like making things, so when I'm at the store I'll get a burst of inspiration for something that I wanna make that I may or may not already have nearly everything for and when I get home, I realize I didn't have something essential and the just end up giving up and watching TV. I'd like to do some of the things on my list, so this is a solution to that.

### Features
- **USER ACCOUNTS**: There will need to be individual user accounts so every user can keep track of their own personal stash and project list. I'd also like to use cookies of some kind to keep a user logged in since most likely they will just be using this on thier own computer. So, also naturally, there should be a log out button as well.
- **CREATE / EDIT STASH ITEMS**: Ability to enter / edit the quanity, type, category, etc. of the art supplies that a specific user has. Also, link to the project list (optional though) if a certain supply would work / be used theoretically to complete said project.
- **CREATE / EDIT PROJECT LIST**: Make an overall list of all projects you'd like to complete. Ability to link to a tutorial or other clippings / inpsirational images collection. Possibly an option to automatically decreciate the amount of supplies if you check off a project from your list, assuming you used those things.

### Technologies
Java
MySQL
Spring Boot
Thymeleaf templates
Something to log in with Facebook / Google?

### What I'll Have to Learn
I feel like there are a deceptive amount of things I'll have to learn to complete this project, but on the surface it seems like I know how to do most of the things already. However, since I haven't really done much with Java logging in and out, that would definitely be something I'd have to look into. I think I'd probably rather use that Google / Facebook account log in integration, though. Anyway, I definitely don't know how to do that.
