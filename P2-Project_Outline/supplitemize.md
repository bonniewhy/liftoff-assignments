### Overview
This program would be a quick and convienient way to keep track of all of the art supplies you have, the back log of projects you'd like to complete, and the supplies you need so when you're randomly at the closest art supply store because of impulsivity and boredom you can look at what kinds of things you might need to buy to complete the projects that you've been procrastinating against because you don't have the right supplies. Instead of buying more yarn even though you already have 30 skeins of red yarn and really, really need orange yarn. The minimum viable product will have you manually entering in your projects and what you need and what you have in stock. However, if there is a way to make it easier and more automatic later, that is which direction I'd like it to go in (For instance, scanning barcodes and having it populate the list of things you own already by itself.) I originally thought of this idea because I am often in this predicament when out and about. Sometimes I just like going to the store, and I really like making things, so when I'm at the store I'll get a burst of inspiration for something that I wanna make that I may or may not already have nearly everything for and when I get home, I realize I didn't have something essential and the just end up giving up and watching TV. I'd like to do some of the things on my list, so this is a solution to that.
