### Wireframes

They're kind of hard to read becuase I used the wrong lens on my camera, but they'll do. Haha.
- [01](https://github.com/bonniewhy/liftoff-assignments/blob/master/P3-Project_Planning/01.jpg): Initial look of the website when you first visit it, not logged in. Breakdown of how it will look on a phone and on a desktop. Breif overview of basic functionality.
- [02](https://github.com/bonniewhy/liftoff-assignments/blob/master/P3-Project_Planning/02.jpg): Finishing the basic breakdown of functionality. Brief paragraph of what should be happening once a chore is completed. Start of pop up designs.
- [03](https://github.com/bonniewhy/liftoff-assignments/blob/master/P3-Project_Planning/03.jpg): Finish the pop up designs. More notes about logged in states and random personalized messages. Start of mobile version of the user's journey. Outlining all of the fields that will need to be present for log in and sign up forms.
- [04](https://github.com/bonniewhy/liftoff-assignments/blob/master/P3-Project_Planning/04.jpg): More things about being logged in or not, describing more features I'd like to implement. Outlining what navigation buttons will need to be present and how they will be displayed on a mobile device. Listing out links and things that should be there.
- [05](https://github.com/bonniewhy/liftoff-assignments/blob/master/P3-Project_Planning/05.jpg): Continueing on in the user journey, listing out the tasks page and individual room pages, then the add task page and what needs to be included. How it will look once a task is added, and where a "Last completed" date will appear. Adding constraints. Tiny wheel design. Pop up for a specific task design.
- [06](https://github.com/bonniewhy/liftoff-assignments/blob/master/P3-Project_Planning/06.jpg): Very breif sketches of what the desktop layouts will look like for index, log in, sign up, and nav links once signed in. Will flesh it out later when I get to the views.
